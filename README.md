# Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree - Udacity
## Project Item Catalog 
In this project I will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system with Facebook. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items, Full CRUD support using SQLAlchemy and Flask and JSON endpoints.
## Prerequisites
I used for creation and runing:
* Install VirtualBox 3 as a virtualizer for Unix operating system. You can download in this link https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* User Vagrant as the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines, runing in the terminal "vagrant up", next "vagrant ssh".You can install with this instructions https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/ 
* Install Python 2.7.12 as an interpreted, object-oriented programming language inside the virtual machine. You can download here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/
* Run python models.py for create database "database.db" 
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file.
* Install Flask with pip install Flask as a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
All the instructions in http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/
